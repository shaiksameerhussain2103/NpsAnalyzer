"""
Stack Trace Line â†’ Repo Code Analyzer Module

This module provides functionality to:
1. Parse stack trace lines to extract package/class/method information
2. Dynamically search repositories for Java files
3. Extract specific methods and dependencies from large files
4. Cache results for performance
5. Provide AI-powered analysis of extracted code

This is a completely independent feature that doesn't interfere with existing functionality.
